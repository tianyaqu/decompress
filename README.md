# decompress
a r package dedicated to decomprsing lzma files

# how to build
you will need rtools and rstuido at first place

make your build tools in system path

go to src/lzma fold and make(it will build the lzma dll and put it in the right place)

then open the project file in Rstudio and build,that's it!

Have fun!
